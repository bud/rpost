2110 Term Project - Team 15

Welcome to RPost!

RPost intends to bring the RPI community closer and more connected. Through the official RPost social media platform, users can post what is on their mind and interact with each other. RPost also offers uniformity by organizing all important RPI information into one easy to access platform with the RPI Events feature. We have Google Firebase that stores images in there. Firebase storage provides more secure and scalable cloud storage . After a successful upload, Firebase generates a unique URL and that is stored in the mySQL table. Firebase allows you to set security rules to control who can access and modify the stored images. Allowed us to set specify rules to ensure that only authorized users can write or delete images from the database. Used Open AI API and Bing API. Used GPT4 Vision preview and Bing Search and News API to implement features. Has a chatbot that you can ask questions!

We have used a variety of tools to develope this application including CSS, HTML, JS, PHP, SQL, and XAMPP.
